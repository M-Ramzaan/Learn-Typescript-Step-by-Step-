//Variables (VIdeo No 08)

// We can store values by declaring variables as below
// let firstName: string = "Muhammad Ramzan";

// console.log(firstName);
// console.log(firstName);
// console.log(firstName);

// let favColor: string = "Blue";
// console.log(favColor);
// favColor = "green";
// console.log(favColor);
// favColor = 25 //Error as number is not assigned to string.

// The number of casing styles used to declare variables in coding can vary depending on the programming language and the conventions followed by developers. However, there are several common casing styles:

// CamelCase: In CamelCase, the first letter of each word is capitalized except for the first word. For example: myVariableName.

// PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase): Similar to CamelCase, but with the first letter of each word capitalized, including the first word. For example: MyVariableName.

// snake_case (or snake_case): All lowercase letters with words separated by underscores. For example: my_variable_name.

// kebab-case (or spinal-case): Words are separated by hyphens. For example: my-variable-name.

//We can use it many times as we want or we can also change its value as we want.

//1a- Rule for Naming Variables;
//1-Variable name cant start from number
//2-Variables can only contain. Letters, Numbers, underscores_ and Dollar$ signs.
//3-We also cant name variable as reserve words like, console, function, new and name.
//4-We can name our variable as name but name is a keyword so we cannot use it same goes for start with upper case like Person we also cannot use it as we use it on specific cases in Object Oriented Programming.
//5- We use constant number in uppercase like PI as PI has constant value.
//6- We ensure that we always use our variables names link to the name that we use that is for others developers when they read our code.
